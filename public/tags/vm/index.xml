      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had stopped using whatsapp because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have it&amp;rsquo;s proprietary app on my de-googled device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-issue&#34;&gt;The Issue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you see, this application is used by most of my academic professors and other colleages, so I had to somehow use it (without the app on my phone, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought of running it through some android emulator, but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to natively run it on my linux machine. [No waydroid as I run X11]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<h3 id="the-issue">The Issue</h3>
<p>But you see, this application is used by most of my academic professors and other colleages, so I had to somehow use it (without the app on my phone, of course).</p>
<p>So I thought of running it through some android emulator, but didn&rsquo;t want to natively run it on my linux machine. [No waydroid as I run X11]</p>
<p>Thus I installed Windows 10 through virtual box and then installed bluestacks in it. But bluestacks was not starting properly (issues with virtualization), which I solved via virtualbox settings.</p>

<p><em>If this still doesn&rsquo;t work for you, I think you should also enable Virtualization and Hyper-V support from &ldquo;Turn on windows features&rdquo; from within your Windows VM.</em></p>
<p>After this, bluestacks started working normally and I installed whatsapp in it and logged in to my account <em>[A strange thing was that all my chats and groups were gone, but maybe that was because I was logging in after around 1 month].</em></p>
<p>My next major work was to get whatsapp web working, so that I could use it on my other devices (of course, not going to run the emulator each time I have to use it).</p>
<p>To do so, whatsapp requires web versions to have their QR code scanned by the whatsapp application for login, so I used a usb camera that I had with me, but I got this error when I tried to use the webcam in my Windows VM:</p>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/img/cam_notFound_big.png#center"/> 
</figure>

<p>It required a &ldquo;Webcam Passthrough&rdquo;, so that the VM instance could access the USB camera.</p>
<h3 id="steps-to-allow-webcam-passthrough-creditshttpsaskubuntucoma1237808">Steps to allow Webcam Passthrough [<a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1237808">Credits</a>]:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First install certain extra packages to get stuff working:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso virtualbox-ext-pack
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Next, we need to find our webcam details using this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">VBoxManage list webcams
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This should show us a list of (for me only 1) webcam/s attached to your host device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now finally we need to connect this webcam to enable passthrough. Issue this command, by replacing the word <strong>Windows</strong> with the name of your VM instance and the .1 with the number that corresponds to your webcam as listed in step 2 (in most cases, it should be .1):</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: This command must be run only when your windows VM is running.</strong></em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">VBoxManage controlvm <span class="s2">&#34;Windows&#34;</span> webcam attach .1
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<figure class="align-center ">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/img/list_Webcam.png#center"/> 
</figure>

<p><em>NOTE: If you shutdown or restart your VM, it will loose access to the camera. You need to re-run the step 3 command to get it working.</em></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With this much, my VM was able to detect the webcam and without much difficulty, I was able to register with the whatsapp web version on my devices.</p>
<p>A small caveat though, remember to open the whatsapp in your windows VM every 14 days to avoid getting logged out of your whatsapp web devices.</p>
